In the actions.js file, a function called updateMessage is defined that returns an action object with a type of UPDATE_MESSAGE and a payload of newMessage.

In the store.js file, a Redux store is created using createStore method from Redux. The store is created by passing the messageReducer function to it as an argument. messageReducer is responsible for handling state updates.

messageReducer takes the current state and an action as its arguments and returns a new state based on the action type. In this example, if the action type is UPDATE_MESSAGE, messageReducer returns a new state object with the message property set to the new message.

In the App.js file, the useSelector hook is used to get the current message state value from the Redux store. The useDispatch hook is used to get a reference to the Redux store's dispatch function.

The handleUpdate function is called when the "Update message" button is clicked. It dispatches the updateMessage action creator function and passes the new message value as an argument to it. The dispatch function sends the action to the Redux store.

The messageReducer function in the store.js file receives the UPDATE_MESSAGE action and updates the state with the new message value.

The useSelector hook in the App.js file is triggered by the state change and retrieves the updated message value from the store.

Finally, the updated message value is displayed on the screen in the h1 element.
